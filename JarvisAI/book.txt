While businesses have been focusing on being “better,” customers have gone
in a different direction. They’ve become more fickle, flirting without long-term
commitment. They switch back and forth to get the best deal, upgrading and
downgrading. This is the expensive and exhausting situation facing many
businesses that typically compete on price, such as banks and cellular carriers.
As soon as they get a new customer, others leave, because the artificially low
price that tempted the customer to sign up has passed and now they’re off to the
next deal. And companies aren’t the only ones facing the threat of competition.
